[Konstruct.bricks 1.1.0](http://konstruct.github.io)
=============

**konstruct.bricks** are a set of common design patterns to help you build quickly without reinventing wheels. They are based on good practise code and past experience.

Current bricks are:

- **Buttons** various button layouts.
- **Messages** various utility message formats.

**Note:** If it feels like this repository is under-developed, it's because it is. We are spending more time on building a good foundation and less on fluff!
